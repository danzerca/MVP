## Sub-Heading ##
  > Community garden crop exchange site

## Summary ##
  > GarSHAREden offers a platform for community garden members within the city of Pittsburgh to share crops, seeds, and offshoots.

## Problem ##
  > Oftentimes at community gardens, much of the produce goes to waste. A gardener may find herself with more produce than she can eat, causing food waste. A plant may overtake a corner of the plot, causing the gardener to trim back the plant. These trimmings could be given to another gardener for propogation rather than sent to compost.

## Solution ##
  > GarSHAREden offers a place for members of the community garden to exchange surplus produce, offshoots, and unused seeds. Members can post images of their offerings along with available quantities, dates, and trade statuses. Unmatched exchanges earn credits that can be used towards future trades.

## Quote from You ##
  > I love seeing all the beautiful things people grow in their gardens, but even more, I love seeing people sharing the bounty. I wanted to create an easy way for gardeners at all of the Pittsburgh community gardens to be able to connect and share their produce and plants.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Using the site is very simple. Select from the dropdown list which garden you belong to and then enter your plot number. Once you enter the site, you are able to see the postings from all garden members. Adding an item for exchange is effortless-- just upload your photo, quantity, and avialabilty date. Select whether the produce is being offered for free, trade, or either. Please note, you must be a community garden member to use GarSHAREden.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "I joined the Highland Park community garden after retiring. One of the long-time garden members told me about GarSHAREden. I was able to easily login and see all of the plants and produce offered up by the members. I saw someone was offering up transplants of asparagus and rhubarb-- two plants that can take years to grow! I was overjoyed! I can't wait to offer up some of my cucumbers once they are ripe."
